I have been imagining why there are people like us who are interested in female urination in sexual fetishism. Are we perverts? If the degree of strangeness of sexual fetishism is used to reflect whether a person is perverted, is it too general? Are those who enjoy watching normal pornography considered normal people? Or are those who enjoy watching pornography considered abnormal? After all, watching pornography is not a common occurrence in people's daily lives. Why do you think we are perverts when you have sexual fetishes? I have discussed with netizens that people who enjoy watching women urinate may actually peek at women's urine, because this kind of video about urination is the one you can most actively bring in. I think what he said about the thrill of peeping at women's urine in reality is wrong. I countered by saying that because you enjoy watching porn with big breasts and your wife can't satisfy you, you will go to prostitution
