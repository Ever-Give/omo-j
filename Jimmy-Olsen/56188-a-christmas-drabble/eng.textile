On a cold December night a young woman sat on a porch with a nice view. She watched falling snow and neighborhood lights. She enjoyed the peacefulness of it all. Her bladder filled up but she wasn't ready to go inside. As a Christmas present to herself she indulged in a rare pleasure. She put an old blanket on the porch swing and sat there. She relaxed until she felt her lap getting warm. The warmth spread over her rump and down her thighs. She sipped steamy hot cocoa while sitting in steamy hot piss. Christmas was a wonderful time.

Another succinct scene with a seasonal setting...

The December day was wonderfully white but frightfully frigid. A lovely lady in fluffy fleece was ambling along the snowy streets. Her bulging bladder made her hurry hastily. A sudden surge of wicked wind made her spray her stockings. She swiftly scampered to deep drifts that blocked her body from everyone's eyesight. Surreptitiously spreading her limber legs she let the liquid flow freely. Her veiled voiding had regrettable repercussions. Strong steam from the warm water attracted attention to her disgraceful deed. The mortified maiden's face flushed ruby red.
