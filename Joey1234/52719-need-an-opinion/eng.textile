Over the summer I wrote a fiction called pee holding camp which followed a group of girls who went to a camp to learn how to hold their bladders.what I want people to do is read through this series and give me an opinion on which part u think was the best and why and do the same with the worst it's a six part series but there quite short I just want to know what I'm doing right with my omo writing of I could get some answers for this that would be great

Note: The series is called pee holding camp not camp omo. camp omo is an incomplete series and I want to know the best bits of my last series so I know what to do in this one
