This is supposed to be a fun thread where we all share our favorite stories from our years on OmoOrg (but if you're new here you can share your faves too). It was inspired by this thread

. I haven't kept a list going so I don't have anything close to a definitive collection of the best stories I've read. What I did here was write down all the ones I remember fondly (and I'm probably forgetting some that deserve mention) and then narrow it down to five stories by five authors. Enjoy!

"Sleeping Pills" - by @G-Force

"The Conduit" - by @Garrus

"The Maid and Her Client" - by @HPattern

"A Yellow Swan Lake" - by @Alltheomorashi

"Diapergirl" - by @Noot

Now please share your own!

Since I made that post I thought of more I maybe should've included. It really is hard to narrow it down!

"April Fooled" - by @EnragedFilia

"Long Day at the Office" - by @Dimwitrolo

"The Night Shift" - by @TrailRunner
