As I usually do for fan fiction, I will use a cast list instead of writing physical descriptions of characters.

Anakin Skywalker: Hayden Christianson

Padme Amidala: Natalie Portman

Jango Fett: Temura Morrison

Count Dooku: Christopher Lee

Padme studied her ship’s scanner as Anakin deftly piloted them to the surface of Geonosis.

“See those columns of steam straight ahead? They’re exhaust vents of some kind,” she told her Jedi protector.

Anakin eyed the columns and replied “That’ll do.”

He brought the ship in for a smooth landing, ensuring to fly low enough to avoid detection on the Geonosian scanners. Somewhere in all that steam and rock was his mentor, his teacher, and his best friend Obi-Wan Kenobi; captured by the Separatists. Obi-Wan and Mace Windu had both been very clear on Anakin keeping to his assignment and focusing solely on protecting Padme, but Anakin was no stranger to disobeying orders. Though he still was somewhat glad that Padme had given him a loophole to exploit, in her insistence that she would rescue Obi-Wan with or without his help.

“Look, whatever happens out there- follow my lead,” Padme said as she rose from her chair. “I’m not interested in getting into a war here.”

She was by nature a peaceful woman. She had argued against the creation of a Republic military from the beginning, knowing that such a move would inevitably bring them closer to a full scale galactic war. Padme knew many of the Separatists personally, and certainly empathized with their feelings of neglect by the Republic Senate.

Unlike the more devout pacifist Duchess Satine however, Padme knew that there were people who could not be reasoned with. She just hoped that the Separatists were not yet at that point. But the senator readied her blaster all the same.

“As a member of the Senate, maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.” She said as she donned her cloak.

Anakin said “Don’t worry. I’ve given up trying to argue with you.”

The pair made their way down the ramp and to the nondescript Geonosian door. No sooner had they entered than Padme realized she had neglected to do something important- she needed to pee. The senator tried to ignore the urge. Her bladder had a tendency to trouble her any time she was exceptionally nervous; presenting an important piece of legislation, negotiating with other senators in private, or any of the times in the past that she had been in mortal danger.

Usually Padme didn’t actually need to pee particularly badly, she just became hyper aware of the fluid that was in her bladder. On more than one occasion she had excused herself to use the refresher only to find that she had barely needed to go at all. The senator sincerely hoped that this was one of those occasions. Even if it wasn’t, there was simply no time for a bathroom break now.

Anakin and Padme strode through the corridor, though something about it made Padme’s hair stand on end. Anakin made a subtle gesture with his hand, indicating that Padme should stop.

“Wait…” he instructed. Padme heard the fluttering of insectoid wings behind her and Anakin’s lightsaber sparked to life. The corridor was suddenly filled with Geonosian warriors lunging at the pair. Padme rushed towards the door at the end of the corridor while Anakin held off the attackers.

The door opened for her and she almost ran right off the edge; the room she had entered was a cavernous factory, with only a small platform beneath her feet. There was a conveyor belt covered in slabs of molten steel some twelve feet below the platform, but no stairs or walkways to reach it. The place had clearly been designed with only the winged Geonosians in mind. Padme, who lacked any such flying ability, had nowhere to go. Anakin was suddenly next to her, and was also immediately caught off guard by the lack of floor in front of them.

Before either of them could formulate a plan, the platform beneath them quickly retracted. Anakin was able to grab hold of a groove in the door with his Jedi reflexes, but Padme was not quick enough. She fell to the platform and landed hard on her feet. She crumpled from the momentum and her ass slammed to the ground.

Padme felt a spurt of urine escape her, forced out by the harsh landing. It wasn’t enough to soak through her underwear and be visible on her pants, but she could definitely feel the sudden wetness. And the pee stain in her underwear was the least of her problems; she was on a moving conveyor belt that was heading fast towards some heavy machinery that looked very capable of smashing her to pieces. She heard Anakin land behind her, but the conveyor belt had already moved her nearly twenty feet. Her Jedi protector was then beset by more Geonosian warriors, who seemed to be completely ignoring her in favor of neutralizing Anakin.

Padme decided her best course of action was to try to escape to a safe place and trust that Anakin would find her. He was well practiced at fighting multiple opponents, and she was afraid she would just get in the way. Padme turned away from him and saw a line of heavy metal presses in front of her.

Each machine took up the entire assembly line, slamming violently onto the molds to help shape them into what Padme assumed were the torsos of Trade Federation battle droids.

Padme stared at the presses as the belt carried her towards them, counting the seconds it took for the machines to rise and fall. Her only hope was to duck under the machine in the space between molds as it rose and fell. There would be no margin for error. Another stream of pee wet her underwear as she prepared herself to roll under the machine, but Padme ignored it as she intently timed out her roll.

She maneuvered around the machinery, narrowly avoiding death several times as the conveyor belt passed under various obstacles. Each time she saw her impending death, another spurt of urine escaped her. The moment she was in a relatively clear place in the line, Padme took a moment to get her bearings. She had stopped peeing, but her white leggings were wet almost to her knees. There was still more urine in her bladder, but she had stemmed the flow for now.

Padme straightened up, searching for any safety in the factory. Before she could spot anything, a Geonosian dropped from the air in front of her. It lunged for her, grabbing her arms and trying to restrain her. Padme struggled against it, but lost her footing and fell off the conveyor belt.

Padme hit a stone surface, and realized that she had fallen into a massive crucible. The opening at the top was nearly three meters in diameter, and the crucible was likely at least six meters tall. Padme tried to crawl up the wall, but it was too smooth. The line of crucibles were being moved jerkily on a rail, stopping every thirty meters as a spigot of molten steel filled them one at a time.

Padme heard the spigot coming closer and closer, and realized that there was no way to escape. She could not climb out of the crucible, and it was seconds away from being filled with white hot liquid steel. With that realization, Padme’s bladder gave way. Her underwear, already wet from her earlier leaks, did nothing to stop the flow of hot piss dripping out of her. Padme pressed her knees together in a vain attempt to stem the flow. The stain spread rapidly across the front of her white leggings, making the material slightly translucent. Pee flowed down her legs in hot streams, quickly filling her calf high boots. Streams of urine poured off of her joined knees and pattered against the floor of the crucible, forming a puddle in the middle.

The crucible jerked forward another thirty meters and stopped abruptly. Padme looked up at the spout above her and closed her eyes. Her pee stream finally stopped, but it hardly mattered. Her death was moments away. Then, she heard the spout stop. Before Padme could even register what that meant, the mechanism holding the crucible released it. It fell to the ground and toppled over, throwing her out across the floor.

Padme stood up slowly, hardly daring to believe that she was on solid ground again. Her relief at being away from the death machines was mingled with humiliation at the state of her wet pants. She examined the huge stain that covered her front and belatedly decided that this was definitely not one of those circumstances where she would have visited the refresher for nothing.

She twisted around to check her ass, but the back of her leggings seemed to have been mostly spared from the deluge of urine that had poured out of her.

At that moment, several Geonosians landed around her. They leveled weapons at the senator, and she had no choice but to surrender. Padme’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment, though she supposed her Geonosian captors may not truly understand how embarrassing her accident was. That one slightly comforting thought disappeared almost as quickly as it came to her, as the warriors rendezvoused with a human bounty hunter (Jango Fett, she presumed from Obi-Wan’s message) who had apprehended Anakin. The man wore shiny Mandalorian armor accented with blue and had a sleek pair of pistols pointed at Anakin’s back. They were accompanied by a half-dozen destroyer droids.

“Padme! Are you hurt?” Anakin asked, only glancing down at the stain on Padme’s pants for a moment before looking back to her eyes.

“I’m okay,” Padme answered. She looked to Fett and spoke with the confidence of a woman who had not just been captured by several alien warriors while wearing pants she had recently pissed in.

“I am a senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no right to hold us captive. I demand that you bring me to whoever is in charge here.”

The bounty hunter seemed amused. “Of course, senator.” He gestured with his pistol for her to stand next to Anakin, and moved them on their way. Every step made Padme wince as she felt the cooling pee squelch in her boots, as well as the wet fabric of her leggings rubbing against her legs. The walk seemed to take an eternity, but eventually the group was standing before an imposing looking door. The door opened to reveal a round table with a hologram projector on it- and Count Dooku sitting at the other end.

Seated next to the Count was Poggle the Lesser, Archduke of Geonosis. The bounty hunter moved to stand at Dooku’s left side while the Geonosian warriors filed into the room. Padme moved to sit in the seat farthest from the elderly former Jedi and immediately launched into negotiations. She hoped her accident would go, if not unnoticed, at least unmentioned. Urine soaked pants were often a hindrance to one’s credibility.

“You’re holding a Jedi Knight: Obi-Wan Kenobi. I’m formally requesting that you hand him over to me now.” Padme said, staring boldly into Dooku’s eyes.

Count Dooku immediately dashed her hopes of having her accident unaddressed. “My lady, unlike the Republic, we respect the dignity of all beings here in the Separatist Alliance. We will allow you to change into clean garments before we begin our negotiations.”

Padme’s eyes narrowed. While an inexperienced politician might take that gesture as a show of respect, it was actually a subtle power play. Dooku refused to address her point, and wanted to open with a move that put her however so slightly in his debt. As much as she wanted to accept his “offer”, Padme knew it would be a poor move.

“I must decline, Count,” Padme said. “The discomfort I feel from my wet clothes pales next to my indignation that you would so boldly hold three representatives of the Republic as hostages.”

“We don’t recognize the Republic here, Senator.” Dooku said in his commanding baritone. “But if Naboo were to join our alliance… I could easily hear your plea for clemency.”

“And if I don’t join your rebellion?” Padme’s anger rose. She remembered Master Ki-Adi Mundi claiming that Dooku was simply a political idealist, and wondered bitterly how the Jedi Council would react to one of their revered former Jedi holding three hostages to coerce her into joining her planet to his cause.

Count Dooku clocked her use of the word “rebellion” as a slight to the legitimacy of the Separatist movement. “The Republic cannot be fixed, my lady,” he said gravely. “It is time to start over.”

Padme shifted in her seat, grimacing at the now cold clammy feeling of her pants. Dooku sat there preaching of corruption while he was in league with Nute Gunray and his Trade Federation. The same Trade Federation that blockaded Naboo ten years ago, starving her people and killing thousands of Gungans and Naboo.

“I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds and the others, Count. I will not forsake all I have honored and worked for and betray the Republic,” Padme said defiantly.

Count Dooku gave her a solemn look. “Without your cooperation… I’ve done all I can for you.”

Poggle clicked something in his Geonosian language that amounted to “take them away!”

Padme assumed that she and Anakin would be taken to a dungeon or something similar, but instead they were brought to a small holding area. They waited for over an hour, neither one speaking much. Nothing the two would say was something they wanted overheard by the Geonosian sentries. Padme’s pants had mostly dried in the interim, but the white fabric was still obviously stained pale yellow and smelled strongly of dried urine. Given how poorly her negotiations with Count Dooku had gone anyway, the senator was beginning to sorely wish she had taken the man’s offer of clean clothes.

Suddenly, the doors opened, revealing a large tiered amphitheater. A single ray of sunlight was the only source of light, illuminating a patch of stone floor beneath an impressive balcony. Poggle the Lesser stood on that balcony, staring down at the prisoners. The crowd was filled with Geonosians, aside from a balcony of prime seats in which the Separatist council sat in attendance. The Geonosian guards guided Anakin and Padme to stand in the light.

“You have been charged and found guilty of espionage,” Poggle declared. “Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?”

Padme stood proudly, and spoke without betraying a hint of the fear she felt. “You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.”

Laughter echoed through the court. “We build weapons, Senator...that is our business! Of course we're prepared!” Poggle said.

“Get on with it,” Nute Gunray called out from the Separatist seats. “Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.”

Poggle acknowledged Gunray, then addressed Padme. “Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena!”

Thank you! I think I might continue this story, including some episodes of Clone Wars later on. Maybe some original scenarios even. I also have some vague ideas for some other characters.
