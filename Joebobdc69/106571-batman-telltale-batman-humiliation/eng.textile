Batman and Harley where having a fight Harley would Knockout The Bat

Harley Quinn: You take off his cloths except his mask and dispose of them

One of Harley’s Henchmen disposed of Batman Suit and Equipment

Harley would then put Handcuffs on The Batman and Cuffs on his feet

After a phew minutes Batman would awaken

Batman: WHAT THE HELL!!!

Harley Quinn: Hi Ya Bat’s feeling a little bare

Batman: WHAT THE HECK!!! HARLEY!?!

Batman was feeling a bit of desperation for the bathroom after being out all night trying to take down Harley

Batman then peed himself of embarrassed with a puddle forming under his ass

Harley Quinn: Looks like we need to get Little Batsy a Diaper HAHAHAHA!!!

Harley Quinn: We got what we wanted we can leave now anyway

Batman waited until Harley Left to undo his Chains

Batman would exit The Building covering his crotch

Batman decided to walk to The GCPD and tell them Harley on the loose

On his way there he would encounter some thugs

Thug: Looks it’s The Big Bad Batman HAHAHAHA!!!

Thug: What happened you lost your gadgets

Thug: Well at least nobody here needs to worry about being hurt because The Bat forgot to get dressed and prepare because he’s too much of an embarrassment to the city

Batman would feel shook he could usual shut thugs up easily but now he had just peed himself in front of them

Thug: Oh you need a diaper for that

Batman would just run away embarrassed and humiliated as ever

But luckily he was just coming up on The GCPD

Batman arrived at The GCPD and would run into Waller and Gordon

Amanda Waller: WHAT THE FU… I want to see you in The Interrogation Room NOW!!!

Waller and Batman Enter The Interrogation Room

Amanda Waller: WHY THE HELL IS THE LEGENDARY BATMAN!!! STREAKING IN GOTHAM?

Batman: Listen it was…

Amanda Waller: I DON’T WANT TO HEAR IT BATMAN YOU HAVE DISGRACED AND RUINED WHAT IS TO BE A HERO!!!

Batman peed himself and it went all over the chair he was sitting on

Amanda Waller: I WANT YOU OUT!!!

Batman runs out the GCPD covering his crotch

Batman then proceeded to go back to walking home to Wayne Manor

He had multiple photos taken of him while he was walking naked.

It would take a while but Batman would finally arrive home at Wayne Manor.
