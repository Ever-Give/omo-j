Another short story about two guys at a movie theater. Hope you enjoy! And don’t hesitate to reach out to talk about anything male desperation related, I’m always down to chat.

###

Austin and Joey were at the movie theater, an hour and a half into the newest superhero movie they’ve waited months to see. Throughout the many years of their friendship, they’ve seen every movie in the franchise together at the theater, with this being the last one in the series. The place was packed, and the energy in the audience was electric.

Austin was excited to see how the franchise was gonna wrap up, but his excitement waned with each passing minute. He made the mistake of buying and finishing a large Coke within the first twenty minutes of the film, and he was starting to pay for it. He had to pee, really bad.

The pressure in his bladder was intense, and there was still forty-five minutes left before the movie ended. But he wasn’t going to miss a second of it just to run to the bathroom, he was a grown man, he could hold it. Even if it meant he had to squirm a little.

Struggling to keep his composure, beads of sweat began to form on his forehead and under his arms. Upon glancing down, he realized the stains of the latter were becoming very noticeable on his grey t-shirt. He rested his hand in his lap and began pinching himself.

As the movie went on, he thought maybe he could let out a leak or two, but quickly realized any leaks would be very obvious on his cargo shorts. He only had on thin, plaid boxer shorts underneath, and he knew they wouldn’t soak up even a few drops of his piss.

Joey had mostly been focused on the movie, but eventually Austin shifted in his seat one too many times and Joey finally looked over at him. He was puzzled by the pained look on Austin’s face.

“You okay?”, he whispered to Austin. “Yeah, uh… it’s nothing”, Austin replied as he began to blush. While Joey thought he was acting weird, he was too invested in the movie to prod any further, and he turned his attention back toward the screen.

A half hour passes, and the ending credits begin to roll. Austin now has an iron grip on his crotch, and a bladder that’s full to the brim.

“Wow”, Joey said. “That was awesome, what a cool way to end it. What’d you think?”, he asked. But Austin could only mutter a shaky “It was great, yeah…” as he carefully stood up to exit the theater. Joey expected much more of a response out of Austin about the action-packed final scene. “Dude, are you alright? What’s wrong?” Joey asked sharply.

Austin was embarrassed, but there was no way he could hold it all the way home, so he came clean. “It was great, it’s just… I just finished my drink a little too fast and I just really have to pee. I need to go, like right now”, he said under his breath. “Ohhh… got it. Let’s head out then”, Joey replied.

They made their way out into the hallway and headed toward the men’s room. Austin’s bladder was hard as a rock, and it took everything he had not to hold himself as they walked.

When they rounded the corner, Austin’s heart sank. At the entrance to the bathroom stood a line of over ten guys waiting. Austin swore under his breath.

The two guys got in line, but Austin felt sick. He was absolutely bursting, and only had a few minutes left in him. His legs were crossed, and he was bent over slightly. Joey watched as he bounced from foot to foot.

A few minutes passed, and they still had plenty of guys waiting in front of them. Austin had his head down and his hands shoved between his legs. “Please, please, please…”, he moaned to himself as his eyes started to water.

The sound of the urinals flushing was torture, and as they inched further and further into the bathroom the streams of other guys relieving themselves got louder and louder. Joey patted Austin on the back sympathetically. At this point, a few other guys in line noticed his desperation. Some felt bad, and some giggled at the sight. Austin was near tears.

He was about four guys away from his turn when a strong jet of pee escaped from his dick. He bounced even harder, desperately trying to maintain control. But then, another spurt came out. He was out of time.

“Ah, no, fuck—“, he yelped. His head shot up and he feverishly scanned the room. A locked stall, three occupied urinals and a few guys washing their hands. Everything occupied. A tear ran down his cheek.

That’s when he saw it. A trash can toward the middle of the room. He considered it for a moment. But it was then that he heard another man’s stream abruptly hit the urinal water, and that was it. He completely lost control.

Peeing full force into his shorts, he broke out in a run for the trash can. He undid his zipper as he ran, and had his dick out spraying all over the floor until he finally got to the trash can. His stream thundered throughout the room, hitting the plastic trash bag with the force of a fire hose.

All the guys in the bathroom watched on in awe, especially Joey. He couldn’t help but peak at Austin’s dick, as he was still partially facing the rest of the room. It was gushing the thickest stream of pee he had ever seen. And to his surprise, he was very big down there. The wet spot on his shorts was big and dark, impossible to miss. Pee dripped off the bottom of the right leg. Austin had his head thrown back and he couldn’t contain his sighs of relief. Joey began to blush.

As he finished up, Austin could feel his face burning with embarrassment. He zipped up, tried not to pay attention to the soaked floor or the chuckling guys, and made a beeline for Joey. “We gotta get out of here”, Austin muttered as he got to Joey, and he hurried out of the bathroom.

Joey followed, and the boys hastily made their way out into the parking lot. The silence between them was deafening. As they got in the car, Austin finally managed to say something to Joey. “If we could forget about this after tonight, that would be great”, he said quietly.

“Can do”, Joey replied.

But Joey was still flushed. He felt so bad for Austin, but he couldn’t help but replay the last half hour in his head over and over the whole way home. The ordeal gave him a boner he tried to cover with his hands for the entire drive. And by the time Austin dropped him off at home, Joey realized he couldn’t wait to go see another movie with him. Except next time, the movie would need to be even longer, and the Coke would need to be even bigger.
