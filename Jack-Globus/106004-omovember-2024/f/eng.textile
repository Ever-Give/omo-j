With just under two weeks to go until the first of November, it's almost time for Omovember to start up once again. For the non-cognoscenti, Omovember is a list of short prompts that are used to inspire and (hopefully) generate omo/peeing-related art, with one prompt assigned per day through the whole of November. As it's been quite some time since the last Omovember event took place on the fiction forum, I thought that trying to revive it here would be fun.

To that end, I have attached multiple Omovember prompt lists here. These range from the years 2017 to 2024. The idea, here, is to take one prompt per day, from any of these lists, and write some fiction. You can jump across lists through the month, or each day, if you like. Entries can be 50 words, 500 words, or 5000 words. These lists are being posted now so that ideas can start to be generated. I will bump the thread on November 1st to let the event proper begin.

The idea is to be creative and to create! The world does not have enough, not nearly enough, stories about people needing to pee! And the world does not have enough, not nearly enough, stories about people peeing! So let's go and change that.
