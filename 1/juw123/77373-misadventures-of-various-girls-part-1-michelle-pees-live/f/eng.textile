It was a quiet afternoon and the 2:00 p.m. newscast was being broadcast entirely live and about to move on to the entertainment section. Michelle, who had not been on the television station for more than two months, was the presenter of the afternoon shows and until that day she had done a good job, but clearly that day something unexpected would happen that would mark her work for a good time.

She used to go to the bathroom before going on screen but this time she was a little late and the time before going on air did not allow her to go to the bathroom so she would have to fight to hold her bladder and not humiliate herself on national television

That day she wore a one-ounce skirt purple with white polka dots, also light purple panties, white socks and white tennis shoes

Her desperation came from drinking two cups of coffee at home, three glasses of water at home, and still a 600-milliliter bottle of iced tea on the way to work.

She went live visibly desperate to pee but she would do her best to ignore it but the slurred speech resulting from her wouldn't help much

She would give notes like the conflict between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard or that Alfredo Adame went viral again for nonsense

She obviously couldn't take the piss much longer and her body language gave her away, added to the fact that she didn't speak fluently as usual.

At one point he began to talk about the consequences to Will Smith for what happened at the Oscars when suddenly a stream of piss begins to come out of his innards.And on the television screens it was visible that she was peeing and she at one point forgot that she was live and took her hands with everything and skirt wetting her in the process

She was very embarrassed and left the forum crying and on her way home where she would change and write her resignation letter in order to get away from public life until what happened is forgotten but in that she receives a call from her superior saying that her accident increased the ratings and now she will have to pee on herself once a week, she doubts it at first but decides to accept the offer but she would take care of making them memorable

The end

Part two coming soon
